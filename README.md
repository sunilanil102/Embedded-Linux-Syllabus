#### CH4: KERNEL CONFIGURATION : : LINUX KERNEL CROSS COMPILATION
- Download the kernel source code linux-xx.yy.zz.tar.bz2
- untar it with 'tar -jxvf linux-xx.yy.zz.tar.bz2
- Copy the new config as .config in kernel top level directory
- Update the the config file using make ARCH=arm menuconfig
- Compile the kernel with make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=zImage
- Generating Kernel Image uImage or zImage, dtb
- Transfer this is to the Target Board and reboot to boot with new kernel image using tftp or nfs
- Application development and Cross Compilation

- Configuring NFS and using rootfs over NFS
- Building the Embedded Board Using NFS
#### CH6: BUILDING THE DEVICE DRIVER AS A PART OF KERNEL(IN KERNEL TREE)
- We will add a Device driver to the kernel
- Copy the file driver.c to linux-xx.yy.zz/drivers/char/
- Edit the Kconfig file in drivers/char/
- Edit the makefile and add obj-$(CONFIG_MY_DRIVER) += driver.o
- Configure the kernel with make ARCH=arm menuconfig
- Now, compile the kernel with make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=- zImage
- Test the driver, with application Program
